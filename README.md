# FireUp-clone
* This game project demonstrates fire up(famous shoot them up game from 2018) mechanics
* This was my second unity project after Ruby Rain(completed at end of 2017), so there might be some old dependencies from Unity 2017(which was Unity 5 i believ	e)
* I have run this on Unity 2019.4.1f1, there is no issue. Only blow up FX animation is being used from asset store.
* If you are interested in this project, i made it open source so you can fork on it and work. Requirement is to have Unity.
